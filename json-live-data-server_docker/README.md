# Remark:
Differences to the original json-live-data-server example from repo resol-vbus:<br>
- config.js: All parameters are resolved from the docker environment variables.<br>
- index.js: The dependency to the resol-vbus library was unlinked from the embedded source code and linked to the original npm package.
